JK Core - A universal software development framework (core library)
===================================================================

JK Core is the core library of the Jkop multi-platform, multi-language application
development framework and API, intended to support the development of different kinds
of applications on multiple programming languages and operating systems. Fully
developed in the Sling programming language, the code is translated upon compilation
to different programming languages to support the different platforms. Currently Jkop
fully supports development in Sling, Java, C#, Objective-C and JavaScript, and is
actively tested on Android, iOS, macOS / Mac OS X, Windows, Linux and the web.

Jkop is fully written in the [Sling Programming Language](http://eqdn.tech/sling),
and also serves as the default application development framework for Sling applications.
Jkop is also an integral part of the Eqela development framework.
